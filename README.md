# School Projects
These are all programs that were submitted in my college programming courses. They all are uploaded as they were submitted in class, complete with comments throughout explaining different processes or assignment requirements to help reinforce the ideas for myself. As is the way with code, there are certainly improvements that could be made, but these give me a great reference to go back and see where I started and what I can do more efficiently with my current projects.

## C - Affine Cipher Program
- Assignment: build a program that uses an affine cipher to encrypt and decrypt a given input txt file into an output txt file. Key must be able to be defined and redefined by the user.
- This was a final project for my Programming 1: C course.

## C++ - Menu Combat Simulator
- Assignment: build a menu based combat game with attack and heal options for player. Computer controlled enemy always attacks, and both player and enemy can have a chance of critical hit.
- This was a final project for my Fundamentals of Programming course. As my first big project, I definitely could have streamlined and adjusted a few things of course, but I’m still proud of it!

## C++ - Operator Overload Linked List
- Assignment: header file was supplied by instructor and was not to be modified. Program creates and deletes linked lists using operator overloads.
- This was my final project for my Programming II: C/C++ course.

## C++ - Sliding Tile Puzzle
- Assignment: create a sliding tile puzzle using an object-oriented approach.
- This was a revisit from a smaller assignment in my Programming II: C/C++ course that was our first larger project after shifting into an object-oriented paradigm.

## C++ - Sort Time Analysis
- Assignment: create a program that runs multiple large sorting algorithms with a timer.
- This was a project for my Programming II: C/C++ course. You gotta love a classic sort program. This was a great one because it gave some basic sorts and a very clear way to compare them to each other and understand their differences.

## C++ - Vector Tower Puzzle
- Assignment: create a variation on a tower puzzle that utilizes vectors.
- This was an assignment for my Programming II: C/C++ course. A great way to visualize how vectors and stacks work.

## JavaScript - Calendar Generator
- Assignment: Create a dynamic calendar using Zeller’s congruence to calculate specific days of the week based on a month and year input. Format using a table and loops.
- This was my final project for a web programming course.
